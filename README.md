## ‚ö† Warning for Usage

This bot involves an infinite loop (commented out) and after some time inevitably, your browser will slow down and your browser (and even system, depends on the system resources available) may start lagging.

Use this at your own responsibility. The creator of the bot will not be responsible for any physical damage that may be incurred to your system while using this bot.

## Usage

For hosting the bot, you have 3 options

-   use the [Serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) npm package
-   run it locally on your own server (for example, using the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension of VSCode). Make sure that you change the `goto` link in `bot.js`
-   Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice and then in `bot.js` edit the `goto` link to the link of the file (eg: `file:///.../insectCatcherTest/index.html`)

```sh
# using serve package
npx serve
node ./bot.js
```
