## Clone and Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdityaBhattacharya1/InsectCatcherBot.git

npm install
```

## ‚ö† Warning

This bot involves an infinite loop (commented out by default. Do **not** uncomment the infinite loop unless you know what you are doing) and after some time, your browser will inevitably begin to slow down causing your system to begin lagging.

## Usage

For hosting the bot, you have 3 options:

-   use the [Serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) npm package
```sh
# starts the game page on port 5000 of localhost
  npx serve
```

-   run it locally on your own server (for example, using the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension of VSCode). Make sure that you change the `goto` link in `bot.js`
-   Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice and then in `bot.js` edit the `goto` link to the location of the file (eg: `file:///.../insectCatcherTest/index.html`)

```sh
node ./bot.js
```
